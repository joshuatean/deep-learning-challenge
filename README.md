# deep-learning-challenge

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

## Summary

1. Initial code for the first attempt can be found in <code>Starter_Code.ipynb</code>.
2. Initial attempt produced an accuracy of 72.52%, with 2 hidden layers using relu and sigmoid functions. Neurons chosen were 50, 25 and 1 with 100 epochs.
3. Subsequent attempts were refined in the file <code>AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation.ipynb</code>.
4. Keeping the <code>NAME</code> column was crucial in achieving the targeted accuracy. Final attempt produced an accuracy of 78.57%, with 3 hidden layers using relu and sigmoid functions. Neurons chosen were 80, 50, 25 and 1 with 100 epochs. 
5. Model results h5 files are saved in the <code>Model Results</code> folder. 
6. Final analysis report can be found in the <code>Report.docx</code> file.
